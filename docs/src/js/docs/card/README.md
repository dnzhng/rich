# Card

The `RichCard` component can be used whenever you want to display some element that includes an image or main part, and a caption or sub-component.

## RichCard

```javascript
<RichCard imageUrl="imageUrl.jpg">
  /**
   * Optional path to image that will show the image above any description text.
   */
</RichCard>
```
